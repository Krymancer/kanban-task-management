# Kanban task management web app solution

[Click here to see live site](https://kanban-task-management-eight-beta.vercel.app/)

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- [x] Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- [x] Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- [x] Hide/show the board sidebar
- [x] Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- [ ] (WIP) **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- [ ] (WIP) **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- [ ] (WIP) **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
